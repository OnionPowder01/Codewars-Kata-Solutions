## Geometry Basics: Distance between points in 2D

**Definition**

This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

Point objects have attributes x and y.

Write a function calculating distance between Point a and Point b.

Tests compare expected result and actual answer with tolerance of 1e-6.

### Solution

```javascript
function distanceBetweenPoints(a, b) {
  let y = b.x - a.x;
  let x = b.y - a.y
  return Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y);
}
```
